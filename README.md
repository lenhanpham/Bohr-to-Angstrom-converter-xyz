# Bohr-to-Angstrom-converter-xyz
Feel boring to convert xyz Cartesian cooridantes from Bohr to Angstrom and vice versa, use this script to do jobs automatically.
Place all xyz coordinates to be converted to a directory, and then run the script "Coordinate-converter.shell" by typing "bash Coordinate-converter.shell".
All original coordinates of Bohr units will be copied to a directory called original.

If you want to convert only one xyz file from Bohr to Angstrom, just type "python3 Bohr_to_Angstrom_xyz.py your_xyz_file.xyz"

The reverse conversion from Angstrom to Bohr can be done easily by changing converting factor in the python script.

### The code was written in python 3
